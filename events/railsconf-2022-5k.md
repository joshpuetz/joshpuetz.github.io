<h1>🏃🏽‍♀️ RailsConf 2022 5k 🏃🏽</h1>

Welcome, once again, to RailsConf 5k! I'm [Josh Puetz]((https://twitter.com/joshpuetz)), and I'll be taking over planning this year's event from [Barrett Clark](https://twitter.com/barrettclark), who will be arriving to RailsConf a bit later than planned. 

Bring your running gear and enjoy a 5k walk or run in the beautiful Portland. This is a very, very casual 5k: there is no chip timing or anything like that. Just an easy run or walk at your own pace with your fellow RailsConf attendees.

We'll meet on Wednesday, May 18 at 7:00 am Pacific time in the lobby of the official hotel RailsConf 2022 Hotel (the Doubletree by Hilton Hotel Portland) near the registration/checkin desk, and head out. The course ends back at the hotel, with plenty of time to grab a cup of coffee and some good cheer before Wednesday's RailsConf program begins.
